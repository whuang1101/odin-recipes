        <p>Lovely perfectly cooked chicken breasts with the best and most simple seasonings</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Boneless, skinless chicken breasts: You can either purchase 
                fresh chicken breasts (my preference) or frozen chicken breasts 
                (which you will need to completely thaw before using). Some chicken 
                also comes pre-brined nowadays, in which case you can skip step one below.
            </li>
            <li>
                Butter or olive oil: Your pick! I like the extra flavor that butter adds, 
                but olive oil will also work well.
            </li>
            <li>
                Kosher Salt: An essential ingredient in our brine, and we will also use 
                salt to season the chicken before baking.
            </li>
            <li>Seasonings: I included an all-purpose blend of smoked paprika, garlic powder,
            salt and black pepper in the recipe below, which is super-simple and goes with just 
            about anything. But feel free to sub in any dry seasoning blend that you prefer.
            </li>
        </ul>
