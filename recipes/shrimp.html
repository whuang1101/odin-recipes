    <h2>Creamy Shrimp Step-By-Step</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat oil a large skillet over medium-high heat. Season shrimp with salt and pepper 
            and fry for 1-2 minutes on each side, until just cooked through and pink. Transfer 
            to a bowl; set aside.
        </li>
        <li>
            Melt the butter in the same skillet. Saut√© garlic until fragrant (about 30 seconds).
             Pour in the white wine or broth; allow to reduce to half while scraping any bits off 
             of the bottom of the pan.
        </li>
        <li>Reduce heat to low-medium heat, add the cream and bring to a gentle simmer, while stirring
             occasionally. Season with salt and pepper to your taste.
        </li>
        <li>
            Add the parmesan cheese and allow sauce to gently simmer for a further minute or so until 
            the cheese melts and sauce thickens.
        </li>
        <li>Add the shrimp back into the pan, sprinkle with parsley. Taste test sauce and adjust salt 
            and pepper, if needed.
        </li>
        <li>Serve over pasta, rice or steamed veg.</li>
